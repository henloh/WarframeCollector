# Warframe Prime Part Manager

As I know about 1/3 of Warframe players is writing little notes on what prime parts they need to farm and where they have to look for them.

Now I say - NO MORE

This WebApp is for managing your prime parts in Warframe. You can see what sets you have complete, how many items you have and most important you can manage a list of targets you want to farm. In this list you can set how many you want to farm and see directly where to find them. If you got a set complete you can go to the forge / sell section and remove the set or remove single parts after trading.

## Installation

You have to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. After that you can eather run the [init.batch]() or run `npm install` in your cmd. After that you can start the app by executing the [run.batch]() or run 'node Server' in your cmd and open [the app](http://localhost:4000) locally.

```bash
npm install
start "" http://localhost:4000/
node Server
```

## Usage

Feel free to use it how you want. You can only use the targets, see what sets you can sell, spam the plus-button till javascript the integer overflows.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Please open an issues first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Plans
I would like to publish the app on a website so you dont have to run it local. 

If you have experience with scaled up node.js servers please let me know.
